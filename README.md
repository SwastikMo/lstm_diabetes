# lstm_diabetes
diabetes dataset trained on an lstm neural network without up sampling or down sampling


the expected accuracywas to be about 90 - 95 % but due to internal working factors of the lstm architecture where the dataset is divided by 2 or more dimensions to make time stamp architecture makes column relationships disregarded and hence leading to an overall accuracy of only 65 % .
